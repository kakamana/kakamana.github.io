Although this article is very basic in nature, but can be useful for future reference when configuring, setting up and connecting to PostgreSQL database through docker container\n\nThis article includes:\n\n- A brief introduction\n- Step 1: Pull the Official PostgreSQL Image\n- Step 2: Create and Run a PostgreSQL Container\n- Step 3: Verify the Running Container\n- Step 4: Connect to the PostgreSQL Database\n- Step 5: Create a New Database\n- Step 6: Connect to the Newly Created Database\n- Step 7: Create a Table and Insert Data\n- Conclusion\n\n## A brief introduction\n\nDocker has revolutionized the way we deploy and manage applications, and databases are no exception. PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system, can be easily set up and used with Docker. In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps to configure and connect to a PostgreSQL database using Docker.\n\n## Step 1: Pull the Official PostgreSQL Image\n\nTo get started, we need to pull the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\n\n\n```{bash}\ndocker pull postgres\n```\n\n\nThis command will download the latest version of the PostgreSQL image to your local machine.\n\n![Docker pull](docker-pull.png)\n\n## Step 2: Create and Run a PostgreSQL Container\n\nOnce the image is downloaded, we can create and run a PostgreSQL container using the following command:\n\n\n```{bash}\ndocker run -d --name mypostgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword postgres\n```\n\n\nLet's break down the command:\n\n    * -d: Runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.\n    * --name mypostgres: Assigns a name to the container for easy reference.\n    * -p 5432:5432: Maps the container's port 5432 to the host's port 5432.\n    * -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword: Sets the password for the default postgres user.\n    * postgres: Specifies the image to use for creating the container.\n\t\n![Create & run docker container](create-run-contianer.png)\t\n\n## Step 3: Verify the Running Container\n\nTo ensure that the PostgreSQL container is running, use the following command:\n\n```{bash}\ndocker ps\n```\n\n\nYou should see the mypostgres container listed in the output.\n\n![Verify container](verify-container.png)\n\n## Step 4: Connect to the PostgreSQL Database\n\nNow that our PostgreSQL container is up and running, let's connect to the database. We can do this by executing the psql command inside the container:\n\n```{bash}\ndocker exec -it mypostgres psql -U postgres\n```\n\n\nThis command opens an interactive terminal inside the container and connects to the PostgreSQL database using the postgres user.\n\n![Connect to DB](connect-postgresql-db.png)\n\nExecute the psql command along with the hostname and user name to make a connection with the Postgres Database Server:\n\n```{bash}\npsql -h localhost -U postgres\n```\n\n\n![Connect to DB](psql-command.png)\n\n## Step 5: Create a New Database\n\nOnce connected to the PostgreSQL database, we can create a new database using the following SQL command:\n\n```{bash}\nCREATE DATABASE mydatabase;\n```\n\n\nReplace mydatabase with your desired database name.\n\nBefore creating, just to display a list of all databases, use the command:\n\n```{bash}\n\\l\n```\n\n\n![Connect to DB](create-db.png)\n\nAs you can see, I have already created a sample database called \"sample_employee\".\n\nTo exit the (END) prompt, use the following command:\n\n```{bash} \nq\n```\n\n\n## Step 6: Connect to the Newly Created Database\n\nTo connect to the newly created database, use the \\c command followed by the database name:\n\n```{bash}\n\\c mydatabase\n```\n\n\n![Connect to DB](connect-newdb.png)\n\nYou are now connected to the mydatabase database and can start executing SQL queries and creating tables.\n\n## Step 7: Create a Table and Insert Data\n\nLet's create a simple table called users and insert some sample data:\n\n\n```{bash}\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  name VARCHAR(50),\n  email VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nINSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');\nINSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com');\n```\n\n\n![Connect to DB](create-table.png)\n\n## Step 8: Query the Data\n\nTo verify that the data was inserted successfully, we can query the users table:\n\n\n```{bash}\nSELECT * FROM users;\n```\n\n\n![Connect to DB](query-data.png)\n\nYou should see the inserted records displayed in the output.\nConclusion\n\nIn this basic article, we learned how to configure and connect to a PostgreSQL database using Docker. By leveraging Docker, we can easily set up a PostgreSQL environment without the need for local installation. We covered the steps to pull the PostgreSQL image, create and run a container, connect to the database, create a new database, and perform basic SQL operations. With this knowledge, you can start developing applications that utilize PostgreSQL as the database backend, all within the convenience of Docker containers.\n\n",
