<h1>Regression</h1>
<p>We will be introduced to regression, and build models to predict sales values using a dataset on advertising expenditure. We will learn about the mechanics of linear regression and common performance metrics such as R-squared and root mean squared error. You will perform k-fold cross-validation, and apply regularization to regression models to reduce the risk of overfitting.</p>
<p>This <strong>Regression</strong> is part of <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn">Datacamp course: Supervised Learning with scikit-learn</a></p>
<p>This is my learning experience of data science through DataCamp</p>
<p><strong>Data import for supervised learning</strong></p>
<p>The data from Gapminder has been consolidated into a single CSV file called ‘gapminder.csv’ in the workspace. Based on features such as a country’s GDP, fertility rate, and population, you will use this data to predict life expectancy in that country. The dataset has been preprocessed as in Chapter 1.</p>
<p>The target variable here is quantitative, so this is a regression problem. First, you will fit a linear regression with one feature: ‘fertility’, which is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in a given country. Regression models will be built using all the features in later exercises.</p>
<p>First, you must import the data and prepare it for scikit-learn. Feature and target variable arrays must be created. Additionally, since you will only use one feature to begin with, you’ll need to reshape it using NumPy’s .reshape() method.</p>

<p><strong>Fit &amp; predict for regression</strong></p>
<p>Now, you will fit a linear regression and predict life expectancy using just one feature. You saw Andy do this earlier using the ‘RM’ feature of the Boston housing dataset. In this exercise, you will use the ‘fertility’ feature of the Gapminder dataset. Since the goal is to predict life expectancy, the target variable here is ‘life’. The array for the target variable has been pre-loaded as y and the array for ‘fertility’ has been pre-loaded as X_fertility.</p>
<p>A scatter plot with ‘fertility’ on the x-axis and ‘life’ on the y-axis has been generated. As you can see, there is a strongly negative correlation, so a linear regression should be able to capture this trend. Your job is to fit a linear regression and then predict the life expectancy, overlaying these predicted values on the plot to generate a regression line. You will also compute and print the score using scikit-learn’s .score() method.</p>

<p>Notice how the line captures the underlying trend in the data. And the performance is quite decent for this basic regression model with only one feature!</p>
<p><strong>Regression training/testing split</strong></p>
<p>Your supervised learning model must be able to generalize well to new data, as you learned in Chapter 1. In both classification and linear regression models, this is true.</p>
<p>You will divide the Gapminder dataset into training and testing sets, and then fit and predict a linear regression over all features. You will also compute the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) when evaluating regression models in addition to the R2R2score.</p>

<p>Using all features has improved the model score. This makes sense, as the model has more information to learn from. However, there is one potential pitfall to this process. Can you spot it? You’ll learn about this as well how to better validate your models in the below code flow</p>
<p><strong>5-fold cross-validation</strong></p>
<p>In order to evaluate a model, cross-validation is essential. A maximum amount of data is used to train the model, since the model is not only trained, but also tested on all available data during training.</p>
<p>Using Gapminder data, we will practice 5-fold cross validation. The cross_val_score() function in scikit-learn uses</p>
<p>In regression, this is the metric of choice. As we are performing 5-fold cross-validation, the function will return 5 scores. The average of these five scores is what we need to do.</p>

<p>Cross validation is essential but do not forget that the more folds you use, the more computationally expensive cross-validation becomes. In this exercise, you will explore this for yourself.

<p><strong>Regularization I: Lasso</strong></p>
<p>In this study, we examine how Lasso selected RM as the most important feature for predicting Boston house prices, while shrinking the coefficients of certain other features to 0. When dealing with data involving thousands of features, its ability to perform feature selection in this manner becomes even more useful.</p>
<p>We will fit a lasso regression to the Gapminder data you have been working with and plot the coefficients. Similarly to Boston data, you will find that some coefficients are shrunk to 0, leaving only the most significant ones.</p>
<p>According to the lasso algorithm, it seems like ‘child_mortality’ is the most important feature when predicting life expectancy.</p>
<p><strong>Regularization II: Ridge</strong></p>
<p>You should use Ridge regression when building regression models rather than Lasso when selecting features.</p>
<p>LASSO performs regularization by adding to the loss function a penalty term of the absolute value of each coefficient multiplied by some alpha. Also known as</p>
<p>The regularization term is the regularization term</p>
<p>The coefficients’ norm. However, this is not the only way to regularize.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could take the squared values of the coefficients multiplied by some alpha - like Ridge regression - and compute</p>
<p>As a rule. As part of this exercise, you will fit ridge regression models with a range of different alphas, and plot cross-validated scores for each using this function, which plots the score and standard error for each alpha:</p>
