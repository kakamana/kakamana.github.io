Regression models will be built using all the features in later exercises.\n",

    "Now, you will fit a linear regression and predict life expectancy using just one feature. You saw Andy do this earlier using the 'RM' feature of the Boston housing dataset. In this exercise, you will use the 'fertility' feature of the Gapminder dataset. Since the goal is to predict life expectancy, the target variable here is 'life'. The array for the target variable has been pre-loaded as y and the array for 'fertility' has been pre-loaded as X_fertility.\n",
