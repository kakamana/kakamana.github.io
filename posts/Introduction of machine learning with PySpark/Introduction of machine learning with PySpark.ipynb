    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is a framework for working with large amounts of data. The purpose of this chapter is to provide some background information on Spark and Machine Learning. Afterward, you will learn how to connect to Spark using Python and load CSV data into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Introduction** is part of [Datacamp course: Machine Learning with PySpark] Spark is a powerful, general-purpose tool for working with large data sets. Spark transparently distributes compute tasks across a cluster. By doing this, operations are fast, but you can also focus on the analysis rather than worry about technical details. This course will teach you how to get data into Spark, and then dive into three fundamental Spark Machine Learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression/Classifiers, and creating pipelines. You will analyze a large dataset of flight delays and spam text messages along the way. With this background, you will be able to harness the power of Spark and apply it to your own Machine Learning projects.\n",
