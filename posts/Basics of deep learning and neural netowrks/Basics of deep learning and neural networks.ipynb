    "This **Basics of deep learning and neural networks** is part of [Datacamp course: Introduction to Deep Learning in Python] In a wide range of fields such as robotics, natural language processing, image recognition, and artificial intelligence, including AlphaGo, deep learning is the technique behind the most exciting capabilities. As part of this course, you will gain hands-on, practical experience using deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting-edge Python library for deep learning.\n",
