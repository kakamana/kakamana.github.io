    "Randomization stands as a cornerstone in the edifice of experimental design, offering a robust defense against biases and confounding variables. This blog post embarks on an exploration of three pivotal randomization techniques — access, timing, and encouragement randomization. Each method plays a vital role in fortifying the integrity of experimental outcomes, ensuring that the causal inferences drawn are devoid of bias. To bring these concepts to life, we delve into the Uber tipping experiment, elucidating how each randomization technique can be applied. We further enhance our exploration with Python illustrations, showcasing their practical implementation and offering insights through statistical models."
