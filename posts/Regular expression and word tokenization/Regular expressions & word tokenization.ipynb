    "# Regular expressions & word tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a discussion on some basic NLP concepts, such as word tokenization and regular expressions for parsing text. We will also cover how to handle non-English texts, as well as more difficult tokenization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Regular expressions & word tokenization** is part of [Datacamp course: Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python] You will learn the basics of natural language processing (NLP), such as how to identify and separate words, how to extract topics from a text, and how to construct your own fake news classifier. As part of this course, you will also learn how to use basic libraries such as NLTK as well as libraries that utilize deep learning to solve common NLP problems. The purpose of this course is to provide you with the foundation for processing and parsing text as you progress through your Python learning journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my learning experience of data science through DataCamp. These repository contributions are part of my learning journey through my graduate program masters of applied data sciences (MADS) at University Of Michigan, [DeepLearning.AI], [Coursera] & [DataCamp]. You can find my similar articles & more stories at my [medium] & [LinkedIn] profile. I am available at [kaggle] & [github blogs] & [github repos].
